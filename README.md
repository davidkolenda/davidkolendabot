This is my bot's source code. This bot was created with the site www.cheapbotsdonequick.com and can be found at www.twitter.com/davidkolendabot 
Cheap Bots Done Quick! Uses the Tracery Language for it's code, and is very simple to learn.
I uploaded this to github for safekeeping, and also, if anyone wants to make their own twitter bot, they can use this as a base to make theirs.
Like I said above, you can use this as a base for your own bot, or to troubleshoot your bot, but please dont take this code, not change anything at all, and then publish as your own thing.
Thanks for coming to my TED TALK about my bot script, you can download it as a .RTF file, or look below for it, and if you want to see more things me, you can go to my personal carrd at www.davidkbr.carrd.co, and if you want to see the bot running, go to www.twitter.com/davidkolendabot. Thanks, and have a great day!
